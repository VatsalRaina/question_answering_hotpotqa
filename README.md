# Question-answering on HOTPOTQA
Question-answering on the filtered (only relevant passages kept) HOTPOTQA dataset.

The purpose of training on the filtered HOTPOTQA here is to develop a question complexity measure. Question complexity is considered in a simple form here by counting the number of factoids the candidate must connect across a passage to answer the question.
